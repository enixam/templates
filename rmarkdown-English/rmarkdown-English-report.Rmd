# Chapter 1
Let's see \@ref(thm:pyth)

```{theorem, pyth, name="Pythagorean theorem", echo = TRUE}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```

# Chapter 2

\@ref(fig:diamond-plot)



Here is a figure \@ref(fig:diamond-plot)

```{r diamond-plot, fig.cap = "this is a figure"}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 500) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(carat, price, color = cut)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```
