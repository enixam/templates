# cross referencing, special environment, footnotes

cross reference for figure \@ref(fig:mtcars)

```{r mtcars, fig.cap = "this is a figrue"}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

cross reference for equation \@ref(eq:my-eq)


\begin{equation}
(\#eq:my-eq)
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}


Theorem \@ref(thm:my-theorem) shows what I want to tell you. 

```{theorem my-theorem, name = "a fancy theorem of mine"}
In fact, what I want to tell you is that this theorem is meaningless. 
```

# Introduction

table of contents

subtitles


This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a ASA article.

\section{Verifications}
\label{sec:verify}
This section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of
text looks like, for margins and spacing.

# Discussion

math environments 

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
$$
cross referencing theorem \@ref(thm:pyth)

```{theorem, pyth, name="Pythagorean theorem", echo = TRUE}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
```


# Conclusion

cross referencing figures \@ref(fig:diamond-plot)
```{r diamond-plot, fig.cap = "this is a figure", fig.height = 4}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 500) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(carat, price, color = cut)) + 
  theme_minimal()
```



cross referencing tables \@ref(tab:iris)

```{r iris, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "my table")
```
